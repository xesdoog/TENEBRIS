# TENEBRIS

Simple DLL injector written in Python 3.12.1

This was a fun exercise for me to get familiar with creating GUIs. ImGui was a blast to work with despite PyImGui being outdated.

## TO-DO

- [ ] Remember which dll was injected into which process to allow future automatic injection.
- [ ] Add a search bar for the process list.
- [ ] Add an option to auto-exit after injection.
